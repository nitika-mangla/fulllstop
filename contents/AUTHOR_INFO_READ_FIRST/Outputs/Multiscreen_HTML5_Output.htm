<h1>Multiscreen HTML5 Output</h1>
<p class="EmphasisSlate">If you have not previously created any HTML5 outputs, 
 you may find it easier to start with the new Responsive HTML5 output introduced 
 in Adobe RoboHelp 11.</p>
<p>Multiscreen HTML5 allows you to create different designs and publish 
 different content for different devices from the same source material. 
 The configuration for each device can be optimized to suit the operating 
 system, be it Windows, Android or iOS.</p>
<p>The steps are quite straightforward.</p>
<ol class="BasicNumber"><li>In the 
 Output Setup you use the supplied profiles and screen layouts or you can 
 set up your own. Screen Profiles set out parameters to identify a device 
 by screen size and / or the browser used. For example you can set up one 
 profile for Android devices, one for iPhones, one for iPads and a catch 
 all for browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome. You can 
 also set screen size parameters for each of the browsers so provide more 
 than one layout per browser.</li><li>In the 
 Multiscreen HTML 5 layout you map those profiles to the layouts you have 
 chosen. By that means the smaller screen devices can use one layout while 
 the devices with larger screens can use a different layout.<div>
<h2>Screen Profiles and Screen Layouts</h2>
<p>The screen profiles and screen layouts are shown in Output Setup. Here 
 you will see all the profiles and layouts available to the project. You 
 can add and delete as required.</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/profiles_and_layouts.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p>The profiles are mapped to the layouts within the Multiscreen HTML5 
 Single Source Layout. On first accessing the layout, all the screen profiles 
 in the project will be listed on the left. They will also be listed on 
 the right and be mapped to a screen layout. If you don&#39;t want an output 
 for all the devices, simply highlight them on the right and use the Remove 
 Screen Profile(s) button. They will be removed from both lists and the 
 order will reflect whatever you set using the Move Up and Move Down buttons. 
 If you add new profiles later, they will not automatically appear on the 
 left, you need to use the Add Screen Profile(s) button in any layout where 
 you want the new profile to be included.<br/>
</p>

<h2>Content</h2>
<p>The familiar options for defining the content for each profile are shown 
 below and you need only complete those details for the profiles you retain 
 above.</p>
<p>Because you can select different settings and apply different Conditional 
 Build Expressions to each profile, you can have different content  for 
 each device. For example, by using different User Defined Variables, you 
 can use the word &quot;Click&quot; on desktop devices and &quot;Tap&quot; 
 on smartphones and tablets.</p>

<h2>Search</h2>
<p>The Search settings allow you to define different search parameters 
 for each profile. You may want to show a smaller number of characters 
 on devices with small screens. Note that RoboHelp allows you to exclude 
 specific file types from the search results.</p>

<h2>Optimization</h2>
<p>The Optimization settings allow you to optimize the output for each 
 device.</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/multiscreen_layouts_4.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<h2>Publish</h2>
<p>The Publish settings enable you to place your output directly onto a 
 server. Use these or just give your developer everything that is in your 
 Generate folder.</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/multiscreen_layouts_5.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<h2>SharePoint</h2>
<p>If you use SharePoint, the settings will need to be defined here. See 
 <a href="../../Employee_Care/Benefits/Features/SharePoint_Integration.htm">SharePoint Integration</a> 
 for more information about SharePoint.</p>

<h2>Generating</h2>
<p>When you start the generation process, you will see RoboHelp creating 
 an output for each of the profiles you included. What you will find in 
 the !SSL! folder is shown below. The index.htm file is not the start page 
 that you are familiar with in WebHelp. In each of the output folders you 
 will find the familiar structure with an index.htm file that is a start 
 page for that layout.</p>
<p>Your developers have four options.</p>
</div></li><li style="counter-reset: BasicNumberitem1 0;">They can 
 put all the outputs on a server and point all devices to the index.htm 
 page shown below. That is a &quot;sniffer&quot; and will detect what it 
 needs to know about the end user&#39;s device and serve up the appropriate 
 help.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/multiscreen_structure.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></li><li>They can 
 put the content for a specific device on the server and link to the index.htm 
 file found in the output folder for the device.</li><li>For other 
 devices, your developers can take the HTML5 output and convert it using 
 their preferred tool.</li></ol>



<p>You do not have to create multiple outputs. You can use this layout 
 to create help just for a tablet or you can use the Desktop layout to 
 create &quot;WebHelp&quot; in HTML5 format.</p>
