<h1><span data-keyref="CoName">Whirl the World</span> - Dependants 
 Leave</h1>
<p>This policy details the Company&#39;s responsibilities toward its employees 
 and the arrangements relating to an employee in respect of unpaid time 
 off to care for dependants.</p>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>Dependants are defined as an employee’s husband, wife, parent, child, 
 or any other family member who lives in the employee’s home but not tenants, 
 lodgers or people employed by the employee. Partners and elderly relatives 
 living with the family are included.</p>
<h2>Policy and Procedure</h2>

 In this topic instead of showing the various items in a table as in other 
 topics, the content has been placed in the dropdowns below so that you 
 can see an alternative way of presenting information. In a real project 
 you would more likely use one method as a consistent approach makes it 
 easier for your users.<br/>
You should consider this when creating content on devices with small screens. 
 Whilst tables make it easy for the reader to locate an item, they may 
 take up valuable space needed by another column with more text to display.</p>
