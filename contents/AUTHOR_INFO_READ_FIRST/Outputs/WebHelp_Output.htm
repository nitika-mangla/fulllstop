<h1>WebHelp Output</h1>
<p class="EmphasisSlate">WebHelp, as its name suggests, is primarily intended 
 to be viewed by users accessing files stored on a web server. It can and 
 often is installed on the user&#39;s desktop but for Internet Explorer you 
 will need to apply what is known as the Mark of the Web (an option that 
 can be applied when configuring the layout). Some users have also found 
 links to Word and PDF files troublesome when WebHelp is installed locally. 
 These are Windows issues, make sure you test thoroughly. For locally installed 
 help the better option will be the HTML5 outputs or Microsoft HTML Help 
 (CHMs).</p>
<p>Below you will find some tips on this output relating to this project 
 and WebHelp generally.</p>
<h2>General Settings</h2>
<p>You can define a Favicon that will then appear in the browser tabs. 
 The start page is the three frame page that shows the user the toolbar, 
 the navigation pane (the table of contents and index) and the default 
 topic. In this project the Favicon is stored in the Assets folder.</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/webhelp_general.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<h2>Content Categories</h2>
<p>Highlight Content Categories to see the categories you have set up. 
 If you are not using Dynamic User-Centric Categories (Content Categories) 
 you will only need to set up one category. Here it has been named US to 
 note that its content is based on the US content in the topics. </p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/webhelp_content_01.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p class="Normal-Single"> </p>
<p>Highlight a specific category to see its configuration. You choose which 
 Table of Contents, Index and so on that you want to use if you have more 
 than one option.</p>
<p>You also choose the default topic. Do make sure you understand the difference 
 between the start page, which you defined in the General Settings, and 
 the default topic. <a data-target="POPUP423966764" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" href="#" class="dropspot">Show 
 me.</a></p>
<div data-targetname="POPUP423966764">
	<p><img src="../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/WebStartPage.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
	<ul style="list-style: disc;">
		<li class="BulletedAboutTopics" style="font-style: normal;"><p class="ListSpacing">The start page is the one that opens the 
		 three frames, all that you see above in the blue border.</p></li>
		<li class="BulletedAboutTopics" style="font-style: normal;"><p class="ListSpacing">The default topic is the first topic that 
		 users will see.</p></li>
	</ul></div>
<p>You have the option to configure using a different CSS for the output 
 to override the CSS you used in the Design Editor when creating the topics. 
 This can be useful if you want to have a different appearance, perhaps 
 in different markets. If you are using Content Categories, you might want 
 each category to be different.</p>
<p>In this example, the topics contain content that is specific to certain 
 countries so the Conditional Build Expression has been set to exclude 
 all content not required in the online help for the US based users.</p>

<p class="Normal-Single"><br/>
Note how much easier it is to select the build expression. In older versions 
 you would have seen the expression and had to work out what would get 
 included. The name makes it obvious. </p>

<h2>Navigation</h2>
<p>Most of the options here are fairly self explanatory and described in 
 Adobe RoboHelp&#39;s online help.</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/tip.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p>Breadcrumb links have been deselected in this sample as the alternative 
 method of including them in a Master Page has been used. Sometimes authors 
 use both methods and wonder why they are seeing two sets of breadcrumbs. 
 That&#39;s why!</p>

<h2>Search</h2>
<p>Most of the options here are fairly self explanatory and described in 
 Adobe RoboHelp&#39;s online help.</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/webhelp_search.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<h2>Publish</h2>
<p>Once your help has been generated, you need to make it available to 
 users. This may be done by installing it on the desktop (please note the 
 warning at the beginning of this topic) or by publishing it to a server,</p>
<p>How this is done depends on certain factors and how your developers 
 have chosen to operate.</p>
<p>When you generate the help, Adobe RoboHelp deletes all previous files 
 in the target folder.</p>
<ul>
	<li class="BulletedAboutTopics"><p class="ListSpacing">In most scenarios 
	 that is fine and all the files will be generated to that folder automatically. 
	 In that scenario, you can either zip the contents and pass the zip 
	 file to your developers or you can additionally publish direct to 
	 the server.</p></li>
	<li class="BulletedAboutTopics"><p class="ListSpacing">Advanced users 
	 may have modified the standard output in ways that require dependent 
	 files that Adobe RoboHelp is not aware of and will not be in the generated 
	 content. Publishing does not delete anything from the server so once 
	 the files have been upload uploaded, they will remain there until 
	 they are deleted manually. That avoids having to remember to upload 
	 them every time.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>See Adobe RoboHelp&#39;s online help for details of how to set up Publishing.</p>
