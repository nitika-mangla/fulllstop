<h1>Mobile App Output</h1>
<p>In RoboHelp 10 and 11 you could generate an Android app in debug mode. 
 That allowed authors to create an app that could be installed on an Android 
 device but it could not be uploaded to Google Play as it lacked the necessary 
 signature. Also it did not allow the creation of an iOS app for the same 
 reason. Adobe RoboHelp (2015 release) introduces a new Single Source Layout 
 specifically for the creation of mobile apps for both Android and iOS 
 devices that can be installed from Google Play or the Apple Store.</p>
<p>Most of the settings are the same as for other outputs, it is the Application 
 Details fields that enable the app creation.</p>
