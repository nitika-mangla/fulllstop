		<td><p class="TableText">Responsive layouts allow your content 
		 to be viewed with ease on desktops, tablets and smartphones. The 
		 appearance adapts to suit the device, RoboHelp takes care of that. 
		 Now RoboHelp (2015 release) adds something extra for your end-users, 
		 dynamic content filtering.</p>
		<ul style="list-style: disc;">
			<li><p class="TableText">You provide the filter options to 
			 suit the requirement be that geographical regions, trade specialization, 
			 equipment type and so on.</p></li>
			<li><p class="TableText">The end-user chooses what they want 
			 to see rather than having to wade through everything you have 
			 provided.</p></li>
		</ul>
		<p class="TableText">Whatever options the end-user chooses, the 
		 results come from one output. Authors who have used Content Categories 
		 with its output for each category will welcome this reduced footprint.</p>
		<p class="TableText">Authors can quickly see how the options will 
		 work by using the Tagged Output View.</p>
		<p class="TableText">You can set this up so that the user can select 
		 just one of the options or so that they can multi-pick. If you 
		 have used Content Categories (Dynamic User-Centric Content) in 
		 an earlier version of RoboHelp you will welcome the greater options 
		 Dynamic Content Filtering brings, so will your end-users.</p>
		<p class="TableText">Dynamic Content Filtering comes with URL support 
		 which means that you can embed the filters within a URL and then 
		 use that URL in CSH calls giving more targeted contextual help.</p>
