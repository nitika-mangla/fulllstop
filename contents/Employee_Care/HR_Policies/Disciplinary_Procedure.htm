If, following the hearing, it is decided that disciplinary action should be implemented; the employee will be told of the decision and given a letter in confirmation of this as soon as practicable.</li><li>In the case of minor offences the employee will be given a formal verbal warning. Employees should be advised of the reason for the warning, that it constitutes the first stage of the disciplinary procedure and of their right of appeal. This warning will be recorded and retained in the employee’s file and will remain active for disciplinary purposes for six months.</li><li>In the case of a more serious offence or if a further offence occurs within the currency of a prior warning, the employee may be given a formal written warning or, where the offence is sufficiently serious, a final written warning. The written warning will state:<ol><li>Details of the misconduct or complaint that has occasioned the warning</li><li>Details of the action necessary to remedy the situation and any period of review</li><li>The period of time the warning will remain active on the employee’s file for disciplinary purposes</li><li>That the employee has the right to appeal against the warning</li><li>That any further misconduct of any kind will result in:<ol><li>Dismissal with appropriate notice in the case of a final written warning, or</li><li>A further disciplinary hearing and a final written warning which, if unheeded, may result in dismissal with notice.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Alternative disciplinary actions short of dismissal may be considered. These are:<ol><li>Suspension without pay up to a maximum of seven days</li><li>Demotion to a suitable job, if one is available</li><li>Transfer to another section or department or to another unit or branch of the company</li><li>Loss of seniority, pay increment or discretionary bonus.</li></ol></li></ol>
