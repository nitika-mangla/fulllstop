<h1><span data-keyref="CoName">Whirl the World</span> - Attendance</h1>
<p>The company wishes to support staff who are unable to fulfil the terms of their employment contract regarding attendance at work for reasons beyond their control. However, the Company expects this support to be reciprocated by all employees so that they comply with their conditions of employment.</p>
<p>This policy is intended to alert and assist managers to reduce the incidence of absence. It is essential that managers have specific responsibility for attendance of their staff and that their staff understand that the policy will be enforced.</p>
<p>Requests for all types of absence must be made to and approved by the employee&#39;s manager.</p>
<h2>Types of absence</h2>
<p>Absence from work occurs for a variety of reasons, but the most common are:</p>
<h3>Company Policy</h3>
<p>Holidays</p>
<p>Study Leave</p>
<p>Maternity Leave</p>
<h3>Absence by employee</h3>
<p>Sickness</p>
<p>Accident</p>
<p>Medical Consultation</p>
<h3>Statutory</h3>
<p>Jury Service</p>
<h3>Unauthorized Absence</h3>
<p>Lateness of over two hours</p>
<p>Non-conformance with the Policy</p>
<p class="Normal-Single"> </p>
<p>The scale of entitlements is sufficient to allow for most discretionary requirements.  However, a manager has discretion to allow up to two days paid or unpaid additional leave per year appropriate for the circumstances.</p>
<h2>Procedure for Unauthorized Absence</h2>
<p class="EmphasisSlate">This procedure is concerned with unauthorized absences that have NOT been approved by an employee’s manager.</p>
<p>To be eligible for sick pay, an employee must comply with the procedures for the notification and certification of absence set out below.</p>
<h3>Unavailable to work</h3>
<p>If an employee is unavailable for work, he/she must inform his/her manager, and give an estimated date of return to work.</p>
<p>The manager must be informed as soon as possible, and in any event not later than the commencement of <a data-glossterm="Core time">Core time</a> [10.00 am] on the day of absence.</p>
<h3>Unable to telephone</h3>
<p>If the employee is unable to telephone to advise they will be absent, a member of the household should make the call.</p>
<p>Information must not be left with the Call Centre operator or another employee - if the employee’s manager is not available, the Human Resources Administrator must be notified and they will ensure the employee&#39;s manager is advised.</p>
<h3>Recording absence</h3>
<p>All absence, irrespective of the reason, must be recorded on the employee’s time-sheet so that the reason[s] and duration of absence[s] are accurately reflected.</p>
<h3>Failure to report absence</h3>
<p>If an employee fails to report to his/her manager, or cannot be located within three working days, the Company reserves the right to withhold pay for the period of the absence and to take any other relevant action.</p>
<h3>Return to work</h3>
<p>On return to work, managers must interview the employee to confirm the reason for the absence. If the employee has a recurring medical problem, and there is no medical advice to support frequent self-certified absences, the Company may require his/her consent to an examination by a Company nominated doctor.</p>
<h2>Procedure for dealing with poor attendance</h2>
<p>The company has control procedures to monitor unacceptable levels of absence because of their adverse impact on the Company&#39;s business objectives. In determining what constitutes an excessive level of absence and therefore whether to commence disciplinary action, the following will be taken into account:</p>
<p>- The reasons for any absence</p>
<p>- The severity of the problem</p>
<p>- The number of absence events</p>
<p>- Any apparent pattern</p>
<p>- The impact on the department and/or employee’s workload</p>
<p>- Other circumstances.</p>
<p class="EmphasisSlate">Managers must identify employees with poor attendance records and discuss these with them. Human Resources must be advised of this action.  The employee must be informed of the facts and records of unauthorized absence and warned that if there is no improvement in attendance, the Company’s Disciplinary Procedures may be initiated.</p>
