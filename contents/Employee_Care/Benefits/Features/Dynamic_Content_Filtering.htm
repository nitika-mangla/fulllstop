<h1>Dynamic Content Filtering</h1>
<p>Responsive layouts were introduced in RoboHelp 11 to allow your content 
 to be viewed with ease on desktops, tablets and smartphones. The appearance 
 adapts to suit the device, RoboHelp takes care of that. Now Adobe RoboHelp 
 (2015 release) adds new layouts with something extra for your end-users, 
 dynamic content filtering.</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p class="ListSpacing">You provide the filter options to suit the 
	 requirement, be that geographical regions, trade specialization, equipment 
	 type and so on.</p></li>
	<li><p class="ListSpacing">The end-user chooses what they want to see 
	 rather than having to wade through everything you have provided.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can set this up so that the user can select just one of the options 
 or so that they can multi-pick.</p>
<p>If you have used Content Categories (Dynamic User-Centric Content) in 
 an earlier version of RoboHelp you will welcome the greater options Dynamic 
 Content Filtering brings, so will your end-users. There are some differences 
 in the setup and these are described below.</p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>To set up the content to work with Dynamic Content Filtering, you need 
 to be familiar with the use of conditional build tags (CBTs) and build 
 expressions. A CBT is applied to some text or an image or any part of 
 the topic content so that you can create simple or complex build expressions 
 to exclude or include that content when you generate an output.</p>
<p>Dynamic Content Filtering allows you to use the CBTs and / or build 
 expressions so that the end-user can choose what they want to see.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>In Employee Care we want end-users to see content according to where 
 they are based. This is shown in this table.</p>
<div data-conref="assets/snippets/Content Filtering.hts"></div>
<p> </p>
<h3>Setup - Global exclusions</h3>
<p>The first thing we need to do is exclude from the output any content 
 that we do not want the end-users to see, no matter how they apply the 
 filters that we make available. That is done in the Content configuration 
 where you can see that we do not want any topics or content that has an 
 eBookOnly, Print or AuthorContent tag applied.</p>
<p>The Conditional Build Expression below excludes them from the output 
 so we do not need to worry about them when we apply the filtering options.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Setup - Filtering options</h3>
<p>With the required content in the output, we now need to set up how it 
 can be filtered. To do this the Use Dynamic Content Filter check-box is 
 selected and the Customize button is then clicked.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/DF_ssl.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Clicking Customize displays this dialog.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/DF_filters.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Icon 1 allows us to set up groups, in this example we only want one, 
 Country.</p>
<p>Icon 2 displays the Tags and Expressions dialog that allows us to set 
 up the options within that group.</p>
<p>In this project we want to set up US, Canada and UK as the filtering 
 options. As shown below, the dialog initially shows all the tags and expressions 
 that have been set up in the project. In RoboHelp (2015 release) expressions 
 can be named making it much easier to deal with those complex expressions 
 where you had to stop and work out what each one did.</p>
<p>The expression shown below is to keep certain content from this output 
 and that was selected in the Content Settings dialog above. Here we want 
 to create the filter options so we select Canada, UK and US.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/DF_tags_and_filters.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p class="Normal-Single"> </p>
<p>The title can be whatever you want so here we have used it to provide 
 an instruction to end-users.</p>
<p>As we only want end-users to select one country at a time, we leave 
 the Allow Multiple Selection option unticked.</p>
<p>The end result in the Dynamic Content Filter dialog will be as in the 
 image below. By default RoboHelp will display the options selected in 
 alphabetical order, here we have used the arrow keys to change the order 
 and we have used a context menu to make US the default.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/AUTHOR_INFO_READ_FIRST/Images/DF_filters2.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>When the end-user accesses the output they can click the filter icon 
 and select from the options you have provided. In a different project 
 you might want to provide further groups such as Region and so on.</p>

<h2>Complex Filtering</h2>
<p>If you want to see a more sophisticated example of Dynamic Content Filtering, 
 see the Travel the Whirls sample project.</p>
<h2>Changing from Content Categories to Dynamic Content Filtering</h2>
<p>If you have previously used Content Categories in WebHelp and now want 
 to use Dynamic Content Filtering with a responsive layout in the same 
 project, there are some considerations.</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p class="ListSpacing">If you used a single TOC or Index with tags 
	 applied, you will be able to use that with Dynamic Content Filtering. 
	 If you used a different TOC or Index for each category, you will need 
	 to change to using a single TOC or Index with CBTs applied, as in 
	 this sample project.</p></li>
	<li><p class="ListSpacing">You can only use one glossary and it is 
	 not possible to apply CBTs to it.</p></li>
	<li><p class="ListSpacing">If you used variables only to allow quick 
	 name changes so that each variable only had one value, that will work 
	 with Dynamic Content Filtering. If you used variables so that each 
	 instance could have a different value in different outputs, then you 
	 will need to make some changes. <br/>
	In this project there are outputs that require selection of a particular 
	 variable set - for example in the Printed Outputs the US, Canada and 
	 UK sets are required. For that reason a new Dynamic Content Filtering 
	 set has been created for this project. To deal with the variables 
	 where different values are required according the filtering option, 
	 you will see that each value has been entered with a conditional build 
	 tag applied.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>RoboHelp 11 Responsive Layouts</h2>
<p>The responsive layouts that shipped with RoboHelp 11 will not support 
 Dynamic Content Filtering. You will need to change to one of the RoboHelp 
 (2015 release) layouts.</p>
