<h1><span data-keyref="CoName">Whirl the World</span> - Company 
 Sick Pay</h1>
<p>It is the Company’s policy that employees should neither suffer loss 
 of basic income nor increase their income during personal illness. Employees 
 who are unable to work because of personal illness will normally be granted 
 paid sick leave within time limits related to length of service.</p>
<p>Unless agreed otherwise, qualifying days will be the employee&#39;s normal 
 working days - Monday to Friday for the majority of employees.</p>

<h2>Procedure for eligibility - Company Sick Pay</h2>
<h3>Notification</h3>
<p>Should you be too ill to come to work, you should telephone your manager 
 as soon as possible after the start of the working day and explain:</p>
<ol class="RoundSquare"><li>Why 
 you are unable to come to work</li><li>How 
 long you think the sickness absence might last</li><li>What 
 action you are taking to mitigate the effects of the illness - for example, 
 visiting the doctor</li><li>Where 
 you can be contacted during the day should the company need to get in 
 touch with you.</li></ol>



<p>If you are not able to talk to your manager, then you should contact 
 the HR Department. If your incapacity lasts for more than one day, unless 
 you have submitted a doctor’s certificate, you should telephone every 
 other day to keep the organization abreast of progress, unless agreed 
 otherwise.</p>
<h3>On your return to work</h3>
<p>When you return to work, you should report to your line manager before 
 you begin work. Your manager will ask you about your illness and how well 
 you have recovered. Your manager will also ask you to complete a 
 self-certificate for the first seven days of illness.</p>
<p>Please note: the seven days includes those days on which you do not 
 normally work, such as weekends and public holidays.</p>
<p>If you have been absent for more than seven days (including weekends 
 and public holidays), you should bring with you a certificate from your 
 doctor. This should explain the nature of your illness and confirm that 
 you are fit to return to work.</p>
<p>If the organization has cause to be concerned about your health - for 
 example, you have had a number of periods of sickness for the same reason 
 in a short period - then your line manager may suggest that you visit 
 your doctor for a check-up. In certain circumstances, especially if your 
 long-term employment is in doubt because of your sickness record, then 
 the organization may ask you to see a medical practitioner of its choice.</p>
<p>Your sickness absence will be marked on your personnel record.</p>
<h2>Abuse and unacceptable levels of absence</h2>
<p>The Company may, at its discretion, discontinue sick pay for failure 
 to adhere to the above procedures or if there is doubt about the integrity 
 of a sick pay claim.</p>
