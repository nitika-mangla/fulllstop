  <h2>The scenario</h2>
  <p>The creation of <span data-keyref="Exp_Dinner_Staff">US$45 per day</span> Care 3 can be likened to updating the help for a new release of software or a knowledge base, it takes what was there before and updates the content.</p>
  <p>The Employee Care project is the knowledge ba<span data-keyref="Exp_Entertain">US$0 per occasion</span>S company, Whirl the World, a global travel company with subsidiaries in Canada and the UK.</p>

    <li class="BulletedAboutTopics">
      <p class="ListSpacing">In <span data-keyref="Exp_Entertain">US$0 per occasion</span>Care 1 for RoboHelp 10, the project used Content Categories so that users in different countries could select from all the content or just from the topics relevant to their country.</p>

      <p class="ListSpacing">In Employee Care 3 for RoboHelp (2015 Version) , Whirl the Word have backtrac<span data-keyref="Exp_Lunch_Staff">US$0</span>cided that online content is required specific to a user&#39;s country.

  <p>Many of the topics are substantially the same for employees in each country. However, there are some differences because of the way the company operates in each country and because of legislation. Sick Pay in the UK is dealt with in a different way because of UK legislation so the Company Sick Pay <span data-keyref="HR_Mail">First Avenue, Anytown, U.S.A.</span>topic has different content for employees in the UK. Also UK employees may be eligible for a company car under their employment contract and th<span data-keyref="HR_Mail">First Avenue, Anytown, U.S.A.</span>at topic will only be available to UK users.<span data-keyref="HR_Email"><a class="popupspot" href="JavaScript:hhctrl.TextPopup(&#39;This is a non functioning email address used in this sample project.&#39;,&#39;Microsoft Sans Serif,8&#39;,10,10,00000000,0xc0ffff)">hr.usa@whirltheworld.com</a></span></p>
