<h1>Acrobat PDF-based SME Content Review</h1>
<p>Among the features:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="BulletedAboutTopics"><p class="ListSpacing">Expand the scope 
	 of PDF-based reviews by filtering topics based on the table of contents 
	 (See screenshot)</p></li>
	<li class="BulletedAboutTopics"><p class="ListSpacing">Include dynamic 
	 HTML content in the workflow</p></li>
	<li class="BulletedAboutTopics"><p class="ListSpacing">Review expanding 
	 and drop-down text and import comments related to them</p></li>
	<li class="BulletedAboutTopics"><p class="ListSpacing">Track changes<br/>
	</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A crucial need for writers is to keep their authoring colleagues and 
 Subject Matter Experts &quot;in the loop&quot; so that requested changes 
 can be synchronized during development. Review and Collaboration workflows 
 using Adobe technology make <font color="#000000">this possible. All the 
 reviewers need is the free Acrobat Reader software.</font>  <br/>
<br/>
A major benefit is that you can send all or just a few of the topics in 
 the project for Subject Matter Expert review. </p>
<p>The Create PDF for Review is accessed from the Review menu.</p>

There are three ways to create a PDF Review.</p>
<p class="Feature_Title">Create A Local PDF</p>
<p>Creates a PDF and saves it to a location you specify. You then distribute 
 the file by your preferred means.</p>
<p class="Feature_Title">Attach For eMail Review</p>
<p>Creates a PDF and attaches it to a new email message opened in your 
 email client. You can complete the message and send it to the reviewers.</p>
<p class="Feature_Title">Send For Shared Review</p>
<p>Creates a PDF and uploads it to an internal server or network location 
 for shared review. This option requires that the initiating RoboHelp author 
 has Acrobat XI Pro or higher installed. The reviewers need only have the 
 free Acrobat Reader.</p>
<p>After all the reviewers have made their comments, the author then uses 
 the Review &gt; Import Comments from PDF command. A Review Pane opens 
 and shows a list of reviewer names and the particular comments or changes 
 they are suggesting. By double clicking the comment, the author can conveniently 
 go to the particular topic and elect to accept or reject the comments 
 either all at one time or one by one.</p>
<p>To keep your content synchronized, after creating the PDF you must not 
 make any changes to the topics being reviewed until you have imported 
 the reviewer&#39;s comments.</p>
<p class="EmphasisSlate">PDF based review is described in more detail in 
 the RoboHelp online help.</p>
